Mark, my apologies for it not compiling.  I am VERY late for work, will try to be on campus by 12:30.  Data members might not be fully set/unset, I tried to keep the functions exactly as is, for ease of transfer/reading.  I pushed so at least you had something to work off of, but I left the *.ino alone so that it would still be prestine for a compile.  If you start on the averaging for the frequency buckets or whatever (sorry, I _don't_ recall the conversation enough), I'll work on finishing that upon my arrival.  The FIR filter will be simple.  I did not add the data member for these last two portions.  Again, my apologies, but I'm running out the door!  --Michael
